The data set and SAS code associated to conduct the analysis is provided. Variable names in the data set are as follows:

Year: Year the experiment was conducted. Data from 2019 is provided but was not used because of flooding that occurred in April 2019 that resulted in uneven spring growth and confounded disease measurements.

TRT: Abbreviations for the various treatments, with fungicide treatments represented with letters to denote the specific sequence of the four applications. For instance, KKKK is Kocide-Kocide-Kocide-Kocide. KKFF is Kocide-Kocide-FungiPhite-FungiPhite.

Block: Roman numeral indicate replication (block) I to V.

AUDPC: Area under the disease progress curve calculated from disease measurements made over time.

Timing: A categorical variable indicating whether the synthetic fungicides applied in rotation with copper hydroxide were applied in the first two (Early) or last two (Late) applications. The nontreated control (NT) and copper hydroxide only treatments are indicated as missing for this variable.

Treatment: Product trade names are listed for ease of interpretation.
